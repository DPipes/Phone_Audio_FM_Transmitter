# Phone Audio FM Transmitter

A device that connects to a smartphone over Bluetooth and transmits the phone's audio over FM. This allows users to listen to their phones over the radio of cars that do not otherwise offer that functionality. In contrast to similar devices on the market, this can scan the FM band and identify an open channel to broadcast on so the user only has to set their car radio to the same station.

This is an electrical engineering senior design project for ECE 445 at the University of Illinois - Urbana Champaign
